Overview
This AR project allows you to interact with virtual 3D dog models in a real-world environment using your iPad. It includes two main features:

Surface Detection: The application uses ARKit to detect flat surfaces in the environment. When a suitable surface is found, you can tap on the iPad screen to place a virtual dog model on that surface.

Image Tracking: This project also supports image tracking. It can recognize specific images and position a virtual model at the location of the recognized image.

Features
Surface detection for placing dog models.
Image tracking for placing models on recognized images.
Interactive touch input for adding dog models.
Realistic 3D dog models for an immersive experience.

Usage
Surface Detection: To add a dog model to a flat surface, simply tap on the screen when a suitable surface is detected. You can move and interact with the dog model in the AR environment.

Image Tracking: When the app recognizes a specific image, it will position a dog model at the location of that image. Ensure the image is well-lit and visible to the iPad camera for accurate tracking.

Customization
You can customize this AR project in various ways:

Change Dog Models: Replace the existing dog models with your preferred 3D models.

Modify Interaction: Adjust the behavior of the PlacementController script to control how models are placed and interacted with.

Enhance Image Tracking: Expand the image tracking capabilities to recognize additional images or patterns.
